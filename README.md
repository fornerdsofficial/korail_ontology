# KTX Rail Maintenance Dashboard

This project implements a mockup of a comprehensive dashboard for KTX Rail Maintenance operations. The dashboard is designed to help maintenance staff monitor train status, predict maintenance needs, and manage maintenance schedules efficiently.

## 🚆 Project Overview

The KTX Rail Maintenance Dashboard is an ontology-based AI solution for train maintenance that integrates distributed maintenance data, supports AI-based predictive maintenance, and provides a data-driven decision-making interface for maintenance personnel and managers.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following main screens:

1. **Main Dashboard (Home)**
   - Overall vehicle operation/maintenance status
   - Critical alerts and anomaly notifications
   - Urgent maintenance requirements
   - Daily/weekly maintenance schedule summary
   - Key performance indicators

2. **Vehicle Monitoring Screen**
   - Real-time vehicle status monitoring
   - Detailed information for individual vehicles
   - Sensor data and operation data visualization
   - Ontology-based vehicle component relationship exploration

3. **Maintenance Planning Screen**
   - AI-based optimal maintenance planning
   - Vehicle/component maintenance schedule management
   - Workforce and resource allocation optimization
   - Plan simulation and comparative analysis

4. **Fault Diagnosis and Prediction Screen**
   - Anomaly detection and cause analysis
   - Fault prediction and early warning
   - Ontology-based component/system correlation analysis
   - Similar case search and solution recommendations

5. **Knowledge Base Utilization Screen**
   - Maintenance knowledge and expertise search
   - Ontology-based related information recommendations
   - Expert knowledge sharing and documentation
   - Maintenance manual and procedure integrated lookup

6. **Data Analysis and Insights Screen**
   - In-depth maintenance data analysis
   - Trend and pattern discovery
   - Prediction model performance monitoring
   - Decision support information

7. **Administrator Dashboard**
   - Overall system operation status monitoring
   - Maintenance KPIs and performance metrics
   - Resource utilization and cost efficiency analysis
   - Reports and decision support

## 🛠️ Setup and Usage

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS mockup, so no build process is required.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the main dashboard
3. Navigate to different sections using the sidebar navigation

## 📝 Current Status

The project is currently in active development. The main dashboard and vehicle monitoring screens have been implemented, while other sections are planned for future development.

## 📅 Next Steps

1. Complete the vehicle monitoring screen with interactive features
2. Develop the maintenance planning screen with scheduling features
3. Implement the fault diagnosis screen with AI prediction visualizations
4. Create the knowledge base screen with search functionality
5. Develop the data analysis screen with advanced chart visualizations
6. Implement the administrator dashboard with KPI tracking

## 📈 Future Enhancements
